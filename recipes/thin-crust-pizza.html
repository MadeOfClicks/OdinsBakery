    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and yeast. Add the salt and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix until the dough comes together. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll each half into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
