                <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, honey, barbecue sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overwork the meat.</li>

                <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Clean and oil the grates to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Grill the burger patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
                <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty and allow it to melt.</li>
                <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill for about 1 minute, or until lightly golden.</li>
                <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the patties on the buns and adding lettuce, tomato, and onion slices. Add additional barbecue sauce if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your Bold Honey-Barbecue Burger!</li>
